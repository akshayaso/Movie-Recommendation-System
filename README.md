# Movie-Recommendation-System
The Movie Recommendation System analyzes a dataset of films and builds connections between movies based on shared genres, actors, or other attributes. It uses graph algorithms to find films that are most similar to a movie the user selects. The system then returns a list of recommended movies, optionally ranking them by popularity or rating.
